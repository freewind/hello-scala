   * Besides require, there is also assert.
   * Assert also takes a condition and an optional message string as parameters. E.g.
   *   val x = sqrt(y)
   *   assert(x >= 0)
   * Like require, a failing assert will also throw an exception, but itâ€™s a different one: AssertionError for assert, IllegalArgumentException for require.
   * This reflects a difference in intent
   *   require is used to enforce a precondition on the caller of a function.
   *   assert is used as to check the code of the function itself.
